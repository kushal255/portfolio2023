    <h2>"Exploration of FAB-LAB Course Module 2 : Understanding Computer Aided Design" </h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        In the second module of the FAB-LAB course, we delved into the world of computer-aided design (CAD).<br> Learning how to create designs both in 2D and 3D using powerful software tools like AutoCAD and Fusion 360.<br> The journey began with Fusion 360, a cloud-based platform accessible via web browsers. This innovative approach allowed us to store data centrally in the cloud, providing convenient access to system resources whenever needed, without the hassle of user management. Moreover, Fusion 360 facilitated seamless communication across different platforms.<br><br><br><br>

The course introduced me to the basics of Fusion 360, an Autodesk software that demonstrated the modern paradigm of design collaboration and accessibility.<br> Following that, we explored AutoCAD, which shared similarities with Fusion 360 but introduced additional resources like the command panel, streamlining the overall usage experience.<br> Both software tools were part of Autodesk's suite and, as students, we benefited from educational licenses, granting us access to industry-standard tools that would prove invaluable in our learning journey.<br.<br><br><br>

In conclusion, the second module of the FAB-LAB course broadened my understanding of computer-aided design.<br> Learning to navigate Fusion 360's cloud-based interface and discovering the nuanced advantages of AutoCAD equipped me with essential skills.<br> These software applications not only empowered us to design efficiently but also exposed us to real-world tools used in various industries, enriching our educational experience.<br><br><br><br>    </p>
